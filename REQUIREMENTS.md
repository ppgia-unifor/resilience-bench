# Requirements

## Hardware Environment

This project boasts minimal hardware requirements, as they are solely determined by the benchmark the user intends to run. For simulating up to one hundred users, a standard personal computer will suffice. However, if the user seeks to undertake more demanding workloads, we recommend referring to the related publications located in the designated folder. These publications provide insights into the experiments we conducted and the hardware configurations employed for those experiments

## Software Environments

The project uses Docker to build the source code, making it a straightforward process that only requires Docker and Docker Compose to be build it.

- Docker 20.10 or superior
- Docker Compose 1.29 or superior
